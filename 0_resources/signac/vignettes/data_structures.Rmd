The Signac package is an extension of [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)
designed for the analysis of genomic single-cell assays. This includes any assay
that generates signal mapped to genomic coordinates, such as scATAC-seq,
scCUT&Tag, scACT-seq, and other methods.

As the analysis of these single-cell chromatin datasets presents some unique 
challenges in comparison to the analysis of scRNA-seq data, we have created an
extended `Assay` class to store the additional information needed, including:

* Genomic ranges associated with the features (eg, peaks or genomic bins)
* Gene annotations
* Genome information 
* TF motifs
* Genome-wide signal in a disk-based format (fragment files)
* TF footprinting data
* Tn5 insertion bias data
* Linked genomic regions

A major advantage of the Signac design is its interoperability with existing
functions in the Seurat package, and other packages that are able to use the
Seurat object. This enables straightforward analysis of multimodal single-cell
data through the addition of different assays to the Seurat object.

Here we outline the design of each class defined in the Signac package, and
demonstrate methods that can be run on each class.

## The `ChromatinAssay` Class

The `ChromatinAssay` class extends the standard Seurat `Assay` class and adds
several additional slots for data useful for the analysis of single-cell
chromatin datasets. The class includes all the slots present in a standard 
Seurat [Assay](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/wiki/Assay), 
with the following additional slots:

* `ranges`: A [`GRanges`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenomicRanges/versions/1.24.1/topics/GRanges-class)
object containing the genomic coordinates of each feature in the `data` matrix.
* `motifs`: A `Motif` object
* `fragments`: A list of `Fragment` objects
* `seqinfo`: A [`Seqinfo`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenomeInfoDb/versions/1.8.3/topics/Seqinfo-class)
object containing information about the genome that the data was mapped to
* `annotation`: A [`GRanges`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenomicRanges/versions/1.24.1/topics/GRanges-class)
object containing gene annotations
* `bias`: A vector containing Tn5 integration bias information (the frequency of
Tn5 integration at different hexamers)
* `positionEnrichment`: A named list of matrices containing positional
enrichment scores for Tn5 integration (for example, enrichment at the TSS or at
different TF motifs)
* `links`: A [`GRanges`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenomicRanges/versions/1.24.1/topics/GRanges-class)
object describing linked genomic positions, such as co-accessible sites or
enhancer-gene regulatory relationships.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Seurat)
library(Signac)
```

### Constructing the `ChromatinAssay`

A `ChromatinAssay` object can be constructed using the
`CreateChromatinAssay()` function.

```{r}
# get some data to use in the following examples
counts <- GetAssayData(atac_small, slot = "counts")
```

```{r}
# create a standalone ChromatinAssay object
chromatinassay <- CreateChromatinAssay(counts = counts, genome = "hg19")
```

Here the `genome` parameter can be used to set the `seqinfo` slot. We can pass
the name of a genome present in UCSC (e.g., "hg19" or "mm10"), or we can pass
a `Seqinfo`-class object.

To create a Seurat object that contains a `ChromatinAssay` rather than a
standard `Assay`, we can initialize the object using the `ChromatinAssay` rather
than a count matrix. Note that this feature was added in Seurat 3.2.

```{r}
# create a Seurat object containing a ChromatinAssay
object <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = chromatinassay)
```

### Adding a `ChromatinAssay` to a `Seurat` object

To add a new `ChromatinAssay` object to an existing Seurat object, we can use
the standard assignment operation used for adding standard `Assay` objects and 
other data types to the Seurat object.

```{r}
# create a chromatin assay and add it to an existing Seurat object
object[["peaks"]] <- CreateChromatinAssay(counts = counts, genome = "hg19")
```

### Getting and setting `ChromatinAssay` data

We can get/set data for the `ChromatinAssay` in much the same way we do for a
standard `Assay` object: using the `GetAssayData` and `SetAssayData` functions
defined in `Seurat`. For example:

```{r}
## Getting

# access the data slot, found in standard Assays and ChromatinAssays
data <- GetAssayData(atac_small, slot = "data")

# access the bias slot, unique to the ChromatinAssay
bias <- GetAssayData(atac_small, slot = "bias")

## Setting

# set the data slot
atac_small <- SetAssayData(atac_small, slot = "data", new.data = data)

# set the bias slot
bias <- rep(1, 100)  # create a dummy bias vector
atac_small <- SetAssayData(atac_small, slot = "bias", new.data = bias)
```

We also have a variety of convenience functions defined for getting/setting 
data in specific slots. This includes the `Fragments()`, `Motifs()`, `Links()`,
and `Annotation()` functions. For example, to get or set gene annotation data we
can use the `Annotation()` getter and `Annotation<-` setter functions:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# first get some gene annotations for hg19
library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)

# convert EnsDb to GRanges
gene.ranges <- GetGRangesFromEnsDb(ensdb = EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)

# convert to UCSC style
seqlevelsStyle(gene.ranges) <- "UCSC"

# set gene annotations
Annotation(atac_small) <- gene.ranges

# get gene annotation information
Annotation(atac_small)
```

The `Fragments()`, `Motifs()`, and `Links()` functions are demonstrated in other sections
below.

### Other `ChromatinAssay` methods

As the `ChromatinAssay` object uses Bioconductor objects like [`GRanges`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenomicRanges/versions/1.24.1/topics/GRanges-class)
and [`Seqinfo`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenomeInfoDb/versions/1.8.3/topics/Seqinfo-class)
, we can also call standard Bioconductor functions defined in the 
`IRanges`, `GenomicRanges`, and `GenomeInfoDb` packages on the `ChromatinAssay`
object (or a Seurat object with a `ChromatinAssay` as the default assay).

The following methods use the genomic ranges stored in a `ChromatinAssay` object.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract the genomic ranges associated with each feature in the data matrix
granges(atac_small)

# find the nearest range
nearest(atac_small, subject = Annotation(atac_small))

# distance to the nearest range
distanceToNearest(atac_small, subject = Annotation(atac_small))

# find overlaps with another set of genomic ranges
findOverlaps(atac_small, subject = Annotation(atac_small))
```

Many other methods are defined, see the documentation for `nearest-methods`,
`findOverlaps-methods`, `inter-range-methods`, and `coverage` in Signac for a
full list.

The following methods use the `seqinfo` data stored in a `ChromatinAssay` object.

```{r}
# get the full seqinfo information
seqinfo(atac_small)

# get the genome information
genome(atac_small)

# find length of each chromosome
seqlengths(atac_small)

# find name of each chromosome
seqnames(atac_small)

# assign a new genome
genome(atac_small) <- "hg19"
```

Again, several other methods are available that are not listed here. See the 
documentation for `seqinfo-methods` in Signac for a full list.

For a full list of methods for the `ChromatinAssay` class run:

```{r}
methods(class = 'ChromatinAssay')
```

### Subsetting a `ChromatinAssay`

We can use the standard `subset()` function or the `[` operator to subset Seurat
object containing `ChromatinAssay`s. This works the same way as for standard
`Assay` objects.

```{r}
# subset using the subset() function
# this is meant for interactive use
subset.obj <- subset(atac_small, subset = nCount_peaks > 100)

# subset using the [ extract operator
# this can be used programmatically
subset.obj <- atac_small[, atac_small$nCount_peaks > 100]
```

### Converting between `Assay` and `ChromatinAssay`

To convert from a `ChromatinAssay` to a standard `Assay` use the `as()` function

```{r}
# convert a ChromatinAssay to an Assay
assay <- as(object = atac_small[["peaks"]], Class = "Assay")
assay
```

To convert from a standard `Assay` to a `ChromatinAssay` we use the 
`as.ChromatinAssay()` function. This takes a standard assay object, as well as
information to fill the additional slots in the `ChromatinAssay` class.

```{r}
# convert an Assay to a ChromatinAssay
chromatinassay <- as.ChromatinAssay(assay, seqinfo = "hg19")
chromatinassay
```

## The `Fragment` Class

The `Fragment` class is designed for storing and interacting with a
[fragment file](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/pipelines/latest/output/fragments)
commonly used for single-cell chromatin data. It contains the path to an indexed 
fragment file on disk, a MD5 hash for the fragment file and the fragment file
index, and a vector of cell names contained in the fragment file. Importantly,
this is a named vector where the elements of the vector are the cell names as 
they appear in the fragment file, and the name of each element is the cell
name as it appears in the `ChromatinAssay` object storing the `Fragment`
object. This allows a mapping of cell names on disk to cell names in R, and 
avoids the need to alter fragment files on disk. This path can also be a remote
file accessible by `http` or `ftp`.

### Constructing the `Fragment` class

A `Fragment` object can be constructed using the `CreateFragmentObject()`
function. 

```{r}
frag.path <- system.file("extdata", "fragments.tsv.gz", package="Signac")
fragments <- CreateFragmentObject(
  path = frag.path,
  cells = colnames(atac_small), 
  validate.fragments = TRUE
)
```

The `validate.fragments` parameter controls whether the file is inspected to
check whether the expected cell names are present. This can help avoid assigning
the wrong fragment file to the object. If you're sure that the file is correct,
you can set this value to `FALSE` to skip this step and save some time. This
check is typically only run once when the `Fragment` object is created, and is 
not normally run on existing `Fragment` files.

### Inspecting the fragment file

To extract the first few lines of a fragment file on-disk, we can use the
`head()` method defined for `Fragment` objects. This is useful for quickly
checking the chromosome naming style in our fragment file, or checking how the 
cell barcodes are named:

```{r}
head(fragments)
```

### Adding a `Fragment` object to the `ChromatinAssay`

A `ChromatinAssay` object can contain a list of `Fragment` objects. This avoids
the need to merge fragment files on disk and simplifies processes of merging
or integrating different Seurat objects containing `ChromatinAssay`s. To add 
a new `Fragment` object to a `ChromatinAssay`, or a Seurat object containing a 
`ChromatinAssay`, we can use the `Fragments<-` assignment function. This will
do a few things:

1. Re-compute the MD5 hash for the fragment file and index and verify that it
matches the hash computed when the `Fragment` object was created.
2. Check that none of the cells contained in the `Fragment` object being added
are already contained in another `Fragment` object stored in the
`ChromatinAssay`. All fragments from a cell must be present in only one fragment
file.
3. Append the `Fragment` object to the list of `Fragment` objects stored in the
`ChromatinAssay`.

```{r}
Fragments(atac_small) <- fragments
```

The `show()` method for `Fragment`-class objects prints the number of cells that
the `Fragment` object contains data for.

```{r}
fragments
```

Alternatively, we can initialize the `ChromatinAssay` with a `Fragment` object
in a couple of ways. We can either pass a vector of `Fragment` objects to the
`fragments` parameter in `CreateChromatinAssay()`, or pass the path to a
single fragment file. If we pass the path to a fragment file we assume that the
file contains fragments for all cells in the `ChromatinAssay` and that the cell
names are the same in the fragment file on disk and in the `ChromatinAssay`.
For example:

```{r}
chrom_assay <- CreateChromatinAssay(
  counts = counts,
  genome = "hg19",
  fragments = frag.path
)
object <- CreateSeuratObject(
  counts = chrom_assay,
  assay = "peaks"
)
```

This will create a Seurat object containing a `ChromatinAssay`, with a single
`Fragment` object.

### Removing a `Fragment` object from the `ChromatinAssay`

All the `Fragment` objects associated with a `ChromatinAssay` can be removed
by assigning `NULL` using the `Fragment<-` assignment function. For example:

```{r}
Fragments(chrom_assay) <- NULL
Fragments(chrom_assay)
```

To remove a subset of `Fragment` object from the list of `Fragment` objects
stored in the `ChromatinAssay`, you will need to extract the list of `Fragment`
objects using the `Fragments()` function, subset the list of objects, then
assign the subsetted list to the assay using the `Seurat::SetAssayData()`
function. For example:

```{r}
chrom_assay <- SetAssayData(chrom_assay, slot = "fragments", new.data = fragments)
Fragments(chrom_assay)
```

### Changing the fragment file path in an existing `Fragment` object

The path to the fragment file can be updated using the `UpdatePath()` function.
This can be useful if you move the fragment file to a new directory, or if you
copy a stored Seurat object containing a `ChromatinAssay` to a different server.

```{r message=FALSE}
fragments <- UpdatePath(fragments, new.path = frag.path)
```

To change the path to fragment files in an object, you will need to remove
the fragment objects, update the paths, and then add the fragment objects
back to the object. For example:

```{r}
frags <- Fragments(object)  # get list of fragment objects
Fragments(object) <- NULL  # remove fragment information from assay

# create a vector with all the new paths, in the correct order for your list of fragment objects
# In this case we only have 1
new.paths <- list(frag.path)
for (i in seq_along(frags)) {
  frags[[i]] <- UpdatePath(frags[[i]], new.path = new.paths[[i]]) # update path
}

Fragments(object) <- frags # assign updated list back to the object
Fragments(object)
```

### Using remote fragment files

Fragment files hosted on remote servers accessible via http or ftp can also be
added to the `ChromatinAssay` in the same way as for locally-hosted fragment 
files. This can enable the exploration of large single-cell datasets without
the need for downloading large files. For example, we can create a Fragment
object using a file hosted on the 10x Genomics website:

```{r}
fragments <- CreateFragmentObject(
  path = "http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-atac/1.1.0/atac_v1_pbmc_10k/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_fragments.tsv.gz"
)
fragments
```

When files are hosted remotely, the checks described in the section above (MD5
hash and expected cells) are not performed.

### Getting and setting `Fragment` data

To access the cell names stored in a `Fragment` object, we can use the `Cells()`
function. **Importantly**, this returns the cell names as they appear in the 
`ChromatinAssay`, rather than as they appear in the fragment file itself.

```{r}
fragments <- CreateFragmentObject(
  path = frag.path,
  cells = colnames(atac_small), 
  validate.fragments = TRUE
)

cells <- Cells(fragments)
head(cells)
```

Similarly, we can set the cell name information in a `Fragment` object using the
`Cells<-` assignment function. This will set the named vector of cells stored in
the `Fragment` object. Here we must supply a named vector.

```{r}
names(cells) <- cells
Cells(fragments) <- cells
```

To extract any of the data stored in a `Fragment` object we can also use the
`GetFragmentData()` function. For example, we can find the path to the fragment
file on disk:

```{r}
GetFragmentData(object = fragments, slot = "path")
```

For a full list of methods for the `Fragment` class run:

```{r}
methods(class = 'Fragment')
```

## The `Motif` Class

The `Motif` class stores information needed for DNA sequence motif analysis, and
has the following slots:

* `data`: a sparse feature by motif matrix, where entries are 1 if the feature
contains the motif, and 0 otherwise
* `pwm`: A named list of position weight or position frequency matrices
* `motif.names`: a list of motif IDs and their common names
* `positions`: A `GRangesList` object containing the exact positions of each
motif
* `meta.data`: Additional information about the motifs 

Many of these slots are optional and do not need to be filled, but are only
required when running certain functions. For example, the `positions` slot
will be needed if running TF footprinting.

### Constructing the `Motif` class

A `Motif` object can be constructed using the `CreateMotifObject()` function.
Much of the data needed for constructing a `Motif` object can be generated using
functions from the [TFBSTools](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TFBSTools.html)
and [motifmatchr](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/motifmatchr.html)
packages. Position frequency matrices for motifs can be loaded using the
[JASPAR](http://jaspar.genereg.net/) packages on
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/JASPAR2020.html)
or the [chromVARmotifs](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/chromVARmotifs) package.
For example:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(JASPAR2020)
library(TFBSTools)
library(motifmatchr)

# Get a list of motif position frequency matrices from the JASPAR database
pfm <- getMatrixSet(
  x = JASPAR2020,
  opts = list(species = 9606) # 9606 is the species code for human
)

# Scan the DNA sequence of each peak for the presence of each motif
motif.matrix <- CreateMotifMatrix(
  features = granges(atac_small),
  pwm = pfm,
  genome = 'hg19'
)

# Create a new Mofif object to store the results
motif <- CreateMotifObject(
  data = motif.matrix,
  pwm = pfm
)
```

The `show()` method for the `Motif` class prints the total number of motifs and
regions included in the object:

```{r}
motif
```

### Adding a `Motif` object to the `ChromatinAssay`

We can add a `Motif` object to the `ChromatinAssay`, or a Seurat object
containing a `ChromatinAssay` using the `Motifs<-` assignment operator.

```{r}
Motifs(atac_small) <- motif
```

### Getting and setting `Motif` data

Data stored in a `Motif` object can be accessed using the `GetMotifData()` and 
`SetMotifData()` functions.

```{r}
# extract data from the Motif object
pfm <- GetMotifData(object = motif, slot = "pwm")

# set data in the Motif object
motif <- SetMotifData(object = motif, slot = "pwm", new.data = pfm)
```

We can access the set of motifs and set of features used in the `Motif` object
using the `colnames()` and `rownames()` functions:

```{r}
# look at the motifs included in the Motif object
head(colnames(motif))
```

```{r}
# look at the features included in the Motif object
head(rownames(motif))
```

To quickly convert between motif IDs (like `MA0497.1`) and motif common names 
(like MEF2C), we can use the `ConvertMotifID()` function. For example:

```{r}
# convert ID to common name
ids <- c("MA0025.1","MA0030.1","MA0031.1","MA0051.1","MA0056.1","MA0057.1")
names <- ConvertMotifID(object = motif, id = ids)
names
```

```{r}
# convert names to IDs
ConvertMotifID(object = motif, name = names)
```

For a full list of methods for the `Motif` class run:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
methods(class = 'Motif')
```
